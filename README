Git-it is a Git issue tracker, implemented in Python. Git-it can register
tickets alongside Git-managed source code for a project, to keep a managed list
of issues, bugs, features or tasks in sync with co-developers and to manage
project and milestone progress.

Typical commands to get started with git-it is:
- Initialize a new ticket database:
	it init

- Push the ticket database branch to an upstream repo, if applicable:
	git push origin git-it

- Other developers can now fetch the branch from an upstream repo, if
  applicable:
	git fetch origin git-it
	git co -b git-it origin/git-it

Then, typical workflow with git-it is:
- Retrieve all remote ticket changes:
	it sync

- List all tickets:
	it list

- Add a new ticket:
	it new

- Take or let go of responsibility for a ticket
	it take <ticket-id>
	it leave <ticket-id>

- Close/reopen existing tickets:
	it review <ticket-id>
	it close <ticket-id>
	it fix <ticket-id>
	it reject <ticket-id>
	it reopen <ticket-id>

- Finally, push out all of your changes to the central repo:
	git push
